# Fork CMS Module: Forum

Depends on the profiles module and [php-markdown package by michelf](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown).

## Importent note

This module was developed in 2013 specifically for fork-cms.com. It was optimized to run on Fork CMS 3.5. As from January 25th 2015 the code can vary from the implementation in fork-cms.com since it's not directly linked to this repository.

The only reason it is open-sourced is because several community members asked for it. I'll test and accept any contributions but will not maintain it anymore. Which means (it is possible) it will not work on the latest Fork CMS version.
